#Task 3: Review Summary

#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

#Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",

reviews = ["This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
"The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
"I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
"Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
"The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."]

for review in reviews:
    space_index = review[:30].rfind(" ")
    short_review = review[:space_index] + "..."
    print(short_review)
